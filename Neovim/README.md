# Neovim-Configuration

Clone into ~/.config/ and rename to nvim.

Make sure Packer is installed, and that Neovim was built from the Github repo instead of downloaded using apt or anything like that, as it has caused some issues before for me.

Once done those, nvim into the lua/plugin.lua file. There will be a bunch of error messages as none of the plugins are install yet, DONT PRESS ESCAPE PRESS ENTER, if you press escape to get rid of the error messages, the script will be blank.

Once inside of the lua script, source the file and then run the command PackerSync, and it should be complete and ready to use!
